                    Under the status-quo, the global norm on CSI initiatives is informed largely by media-driven moral sensationalism as well as the “negative incentive” of state compliance for businesses. Both of these, feed into the standard rejection and stagnation of CSI models as a whole- unsurprisingly from both ends of the spectrum. A change is needed.

                            <h5>CORPORATE GLOBALIZATION</h5>
                            Corporate Globalization is the phenomenon that sees industries and companies establish themselves and conduct business around the world with relative ease. Be it reduced transaction costs, minimal trade tariffs or profit-centered labor and tax legislation; businesses and industry growth is heavily characterized by breaking into new markets and delivering products and services to people across the globe.
                            Undoubtedly, the most unfortunate and urgent factor that accompanies the globalization of business and trade is the globalization of social issues. Primarily, the issues that affect the countries in which global entities operate (global entities here are understood as either operating in more than one country, or having a supply chain that includes actors outside the country of origin) have consequences not only for its operations abroad but for the countries from which they originate in their entirety.
                            This immediately begs the question: what contribution can profit-driven entities make in the reduction of social issues and meaningful structural change, not only in the foreign countries their operations and links in the supply chain are, but also the countries of their origin?

                            <h5>DEVELOPMENT IMPERATIVES</h5>
                            We can make several inferences from the fundamentally globalized nature in which human society interacts and the way businesses expand and generate massive revenues. These inferences underwrite the imperatives the private sector has towards global development. Businesses have a role and capacity (outside of legislative power) equal to that of governments and NGO’s in contributing to development all over the world.
                            Human progress and business growth are inextricably linked. We cannot deny that the growth of business, through the generation of profit is linked to the development of human society, through the consumption of goods and services; the demand for which is informed by value and necessity. The task of reconciling profit incentives and development imperatives (for people that consume products and services) is necessary in the strategic framework of how the private sector is engaged on its social responsibility.

                        NSI Consultants is a global consulting organization, providing CSI/CSR solutions in the interest of strengthening of communities and improving corporate citizenship. Our operations span 4 countries presently (The United States, South Africa, Dubai and Norway) and we seek to grow and expand, in order to inject the utility brought about by globalization, into the field of social investment.
                        Our mission and vision is to transform the manner in which corporate citizenship is carried out, as well as the lens through which value creation (for communities affected by varying issues) is understood in an increasingly unequal yet increasingly integrated global village. As an organization, we are driven by an awareness of the need to reconcile the interests of business with the needs and imperatives of human development around the world. We are an organization that doesn’t wish to prioritize one over the other. Rather, we endeavor to develop corporate citizenship models and practices that make both these facets of society congruent.

                        NSI Consultants provides tailor made packages for all social investment (and development) stakeholders to ensure that all parties meet the objectives of social investment as well as social change. We provide tailor made CSI consulting packages which include:
                        - Project Identification and Benchmarking for CSI initiatives.
                        - Civic Education and Training for employees.
                        - Strategic Project Development (internally, should the client already have internal CSR structures)
                        - Reporting on CSI projects; for measurable results and analysis.
                        For NGO’s and all other non-governmental social change agents (mainly local organizations that lack institutional capacity), our consultation services are also tailor made and project specific. They operate on slightly different parameters. Our consultation services:
                        - Fundraising assistance.
                        - Planning assistance: Helping NGO’s maximize donor funds.
                        - Monitoring and Reporting (on the progress of development initiatives).

                        The work of NSI Consultants from an institutional perspective seeks to do with away with the archaic model that sees legislature informing (through incentive and moral coercion), businesses complying (mostly for reactive reasons), and communities effectively losing out on substantive and measurable benefits and progress. This is no aspersion, the state of some of the world’s most underdeveloped societies (particularly in extractive economies) against the amount of money spent by the developed world on CSR make this undeniable. From this, NSI Consultants works in the interest of designing an institutional framework and network that sees governments, NGO’s, businesses and communities constantly engaging and formulating shared interests and values.
                        NSI Consultants develops projects and administers its services for clients in a manner that is specific to their needs and imperatives and institutional capacity. The end goal in the work of NSI Consultants is determined by our most important client: underdeveloped communities. The interests of the communities are the pivot of our work. Our understanding of globalization and the context it creates for every stakeholder makes it clear to us that utility is not only to be shared across the institutional spectrum, but it is to be maximized in the interests of all parties, on the foundation of community interests.
                        What makes this firm distinct is that its social utility maximization agenda relies on the global transfer and exchange of resources, finances and knowledge- creating a borderless CSI/CSR model. We are aware of the fact that discrepancies in currency and commodities means that what is worth a set amount in one country, can end up being worth multiple times more in another country, across the global economic divide. This is why the organization is borderless- CSI spending has the potential to not only be effective but also efficient for stakeholders.
